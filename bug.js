This React Native code uses the deprecated `componentWillReceiveProps` lifecycle method.  It attempts to update state based on changes in props. This can lead to unexpected behavior and infinite loops.

```javascript
componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
  if (nextProps.data !== this.props.data) {
    this.setState({ data: nextProps.data });
  }
}
```
